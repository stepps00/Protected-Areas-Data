## What is Protected Areas Data?

Protected Areas Data is a series of openly-licensed spatial datasets, representing protected areas around the world. Each protected area is represented by a polygon geometry and a standardized set of properties. As of mid-2024, protected areas in **50** countries have been catalogued in Protected Areas Data.

## What is a protected area?

According to the [IUCN](https://www.iucn.org/), a protected area is defined as “an area of land and/or sea especially dedicated to the protection and maintenance of biological diversity, and of natural and associated cultural resources, and managed through legal or other effective means” ([1](https://www.iucn.org/resources/publication/protecting-nature-regional-reviews-protected-areas), [2](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=WZpSj1RSdwgC&oi=fnd&pg=PP11&dq=IUCN+(1994)+Guidelines+for+Protected+Area+Management+Categories.+IUCN,+Gland,+Switzerland,+and+Cambridge,+UK.&ots=ol3I7gnE5f&sig=4nY1TxAThdnWXLNca7mJL8nrvg8#v=onepage&q&f=false)). The data in this repository tries to capture an up-to-date set of these areas in Chile.
